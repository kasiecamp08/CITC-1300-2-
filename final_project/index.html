        <h3>Konata Izumi</h3>
        <p>Konata is the leader of the Lucky Star crew, and the main protagonist of the series. She is the shortest of the main characters. Nicknamed "Kona-chan" (こなちゃん), she is an eccentric but friendly and outgoing tomboy, with a mischievous yet good-natured sense of humor. She is smart, but doesn't apply herself to studying,[1] thus her grades are a bit variable.</p>

    <h3>Joy Turner</h3>
   <p>Earl's wife Joy throws him out, keeping her two children herself: Dodge, whom she conceived before getting together with Earl, and Earl Jr., who was fathered during their marriage, but not by Earl. Earl moves into a motel and lives with his brother Randy, and they meet Catalina, the motel's beautiful maid who illegally emigrated from somewhere in Latin America. Earl works on the list which mostly involves strangers and old acquaintances he has wronged, but also contains items involving his family. Initially Joy plots to kill or blackmail Earl for his lottery winnings, but later gives up. Joy marries Darnell Turner, a mutual friend who works at a local restaurant called the Crab Shack, and with whom she had been having an affair.</p>
