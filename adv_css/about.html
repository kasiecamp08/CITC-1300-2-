        <h2>About My Name is Earl and Pictures</h2>
        <p>Most episodes from the first season, then only a few from the rest, began with Earl presenting the premise of the series: "You know the kind of guy who does nothing but bad things and then wonders why his life sucks? Well, that was me. Every time something good happened to me, something bad was always waiting around the corner: karma. That's when I realized that I had to change. So, I made a list of everything bad I've ever done, and one by one I'm gonna make up for all my mistakes. I'm just trying to be a better person. My name is Earl."</p>
