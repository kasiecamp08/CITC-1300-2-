        <h3>Konata Izumi</h3>
        <p>Konata is the leader of the Lucky Star crew, and the main protagonist of the series. She is the shortest of the main characters. Nicknamed "Kona-chan" (こなちゃん), she is an eccentric but friendly and outgoing tomboy, with a mischievous yet good-natured sense of humor. She is smart, but doesn't apply herself to studying,[1] thus her grades are a bit variable.</p>

    <h3>Kagami Hiigari</h3>
   <p>Kagami is the older fraternal twin sister of Tsukasa Hiiragi. In school, her grades are excellent, as she studies very hard, and she was elected class president in her first year. She is in a different class than Konata Izumi and Tsukasa, but she frequently comes to their class during lunch time to eat with Tsukasa.</p>

    <h3>Joy Turner</h3>
   <p>Tsukasa is the younger fraternal twin sister of Kagami Hiiragi and lives in a six-member family household as the youngest member.She is in the same class as Konata Izumi and excels in cooking. Kagami often uses the term "birds of a feather" to describe the similarities between Tsukasa and Konata, mostly their bad habits. Both often depend on Kagami for help on her homework, but their reasons are different: Tsukasa easily forgets her assignments, while Konata is just too lazy or preoccupied with her hobbies to do them herself.</p>
